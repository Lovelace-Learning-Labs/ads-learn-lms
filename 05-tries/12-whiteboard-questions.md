## Tries

### Instructions

For each question:

- Design an algorithm that solves the problem
- Pseudocode your algorithm
- Identify interesting test cases and run them by hand
- Analyze the time and space complexities of the algorithm
- Implement your algorithm (including tests) in JavaScript to check your work
- Find a solution online, and check that you were on the right track
