# Whiteboard Questions

## Red-Black Trees

### Instructions

For each question:

- Design an algorithm that solves the problem
- Pseudocode your algorithm
- Identify interesting test cases and run them by hand
- Analyze the time and space complexities of the algorithm
- Implement your algorithm (including tests) in JavaScript to check your work
- Find a solution online, and check that you were on the right track

### Questions

1. Write an algorithm to determine whether a binary tree is a red-black tree

Honestly there's not much new here for RBTs. The BST questions from last week pretty much cover it.

If you're hankering for something to do, go implement the `delete` function for red-black trees - that's suitably tricky.

Once you've got that, implement a `removeMax` function that removes the record with the largest key, then turn your RBT into a priority queue.
