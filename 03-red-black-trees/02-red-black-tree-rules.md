# Red-Black-Tree Rules

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to...

* **Define** the terms red-black tree, black-depth and rebalance
* **Explain** how, by following a set of rules, red-black trees can keep themselves balanced as they grow
* **List** the red-black tree rules
