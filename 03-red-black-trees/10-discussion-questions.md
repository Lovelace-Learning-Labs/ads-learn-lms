# Discussion Questions

## Red-Black Trees

Please read through these before class, and come prepared to have a meaningful discussion with your peers

For each question we'll discuss in small groups, then as a big group

## General

1. Introduce yourself to your group!
1. What questions or comments do you have after watching the video lectures?
1. Come up with a description in your own words of how, by adding a bit of code to the end of the insert function, a red-black tree is able to guarantee \\(O(log(n))\\) time for insert and delete.
    - Don't worry about getting into the mechanics of the fixup algorithm, stick with the big picture.
1. What is the largest possible number of nodes for a red-black tree of black-height \\(k\\)? The smallest possible?
1. Will inserting a new node into a red-black tree that already has at least one node ever result in a completely black tree? Or will there always be at least one red node?
1. How would you serialize and deserialize a red-black tree? Do you need to store any information about the structure of the tree?
