# Whiteboard Questions

## B-Trees

### Instructions

For each question:

- Design an algorithm that solves the problem
- Pseudocode your algorithm
- Identify interesting test cases and run them by hand
- Analyze the time and space complexities of the algorithm
- Implement your algorithm (including tests) in JavaScript to check your work
- Find a solution online, and check that you were on the right track

### Questions

1. Write a function to get a list of keys at a given depth in a B-Tree
1. Write a function to print a B-Tree to the terminal
1. Write functions to serialize and deserialize a B-Tree
1. Imagine someone gives you a sorted array of keys. Construct a B-Tree containing those keys that has
    - As few nodes as possible
    - As many nodes as possible
