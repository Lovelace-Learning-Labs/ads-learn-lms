# Memory Swapping

## Learning Goals

## Summary

**Secondary memory** (disk) is 100x cheaper but 100,000x slower than **main memory** (RAM). As a result, most computers have way more disk space than RAM.

Memory is organized into fixed-size **pages** of a few KB each. To boost performance, secondary memory is always read / written in page.

**Swapping** pages of main memory out to disk lets us pretend we have extra memory available.
