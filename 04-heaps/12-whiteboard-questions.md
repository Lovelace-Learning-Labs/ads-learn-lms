# Whiteboard Questions

## Heaps

### Instructions

For each question:

- Design an algorithm that solves the problem
- Pseudocode your algorithm
- Identify interesting test cases and run them by hand
- Analyze the time and space complexities of the algorithm
- Implement your algorithm (including tests) in JavaScript to check your work
- Find a solution online, and check that you were on the right track

### Questions

1. Write an algorithm to determine whether an array is a heap.
1. Write algorithms to transform a heap into a binary search tree and vice versa. Can you do it in \\(O(n)\\) time?
1. Write an algorithm to convert a max heap to a min heap in linear time.
1. Write algorithms to serialize and deserialize a heap. What (if any) information do you need to store about the structure of the heap?
1. Read about and implement [huffman coding](https://www.techiedelight.com/huffman-coding/). This is extra tricky in JS because it lacks a way to directly encode binary data, but it is possible! Do some research!
