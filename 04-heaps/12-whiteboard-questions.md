# Whiteboard Questions

## Heaps

### Instructions

For each question:

- Design an algorithm that solves the problem
- Pseudocode your algorithm
- Identify interesting test cases and run them by hand
- Analyze the time and space complexities of the algorithm
- Implement your algorithm (including tests) in JavaScript to check your work
- Find a solution online, and check that you were on the right track

### Questions

1. Write algorithms to transform a heap into a binary tree and vice versa. Can you do it in \\(O(n)\\) time?
