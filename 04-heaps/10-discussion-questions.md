# Discussion Questions

## Heaps

Please read through these before class, and come prepared to have a meaningful discussion with your peers

For each question we'll discuss in small groups, then as a big group

## General

1. Introduce yourself to your group!
1. What questions or comments do you have after watching the video lectures?
1. Is it possible for a tree to satisfy both the BST property and the max-heap property? Give an example or explain why not.
1. In class we discussed max-heaps. Min-heaps also exist, they're the same except for the record with minimum priority is what gets removed. How would you need to change your heap implementation to get a min-heap?
