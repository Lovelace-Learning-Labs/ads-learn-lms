## Challenges

[It's recommended that each lesson has at least one challenge. Challenges make the content interactive and give instructors visibility into student learning. These challenge can be spread out in between content, or can be at the end of the lesson. Examples of all challenge types are in this unit -- https://learn-2.galvanize.com/cohorts/667/blocks/13/content_files/Multiple-Choice-Challenge.md]
